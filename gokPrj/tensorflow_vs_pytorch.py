# Workout 
# Submit max models before 7pm



# using thesame parameters
# epoch = 30
# maxIteration = 5
# save file name ending with suffix of accuracy.
# 



# extract the code for simulating tensorflow
# separate module (cv_image_tensorflow_model.py)



# extract the code for simulating pytorch
# separate module (cv_image_pytorch_model.py)




# load the saved models with the highest accuracy for tensorflow and pytorch
# and predict for same set of dataImages
# (cv_image_tensorflow_vs_pytorch.py)




# Get your project dataset ready for presentation tomorrow.
